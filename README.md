## Data Structures
- Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. 
- They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. 
- But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages.
- So how do you identify a data structure that is suitable for a particular task? What is meant by the term ‘Data Structure’? 
- How many types of data structures are there and what are they used for?

### Types of Data Structures
- Arrays: An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations.
- Linked Lists: It is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations and the elements are linked with each other.
- Stacks: Follow LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. In this, the last element in the stack will be removed first.
- Queues: It follows the FIFO principle (First In First Out), in this, the first element stored is removed first.
- Hash Tables: This is a type of data structure that stores values which have keys related to each of them.
- Trees: It is a data structure in which data is organized hierarchically and linked together. Some Examples are the Binary Search tree, Binary tree, Splay tree, AVL Tree, etc.
- Heaps: It is a specialized tree-based data structure, also called binary heap in which data is stored.
- Graphs: It consists of a set of nodes and edges connecting each other.

### Characteristics of Algorithm
- Clear and Unambiguous: The algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning.
- Well-Defined Inputs: If an algorithm says to take inputs, it should be well-defined inputs. 
- Well-Defined Outputs: The algorithm must clearly define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined as well. 
- Finite-ness: The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should terminate after a finite time.
- Feasible: The algorithm must be simple, generic, and practical, such that it can be executed with the available resources. It must not contain some future technology or anything.
- Language Independent: The Algorithm designed must be language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.
